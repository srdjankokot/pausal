  "privacyGoogleSheetsTitle": "Google Sheets file you select",
  "privacyGoogleSheetsDesc": "The app uses Google Picker and \"drive.file\" permission to allow you to manually select a specific Google Sheets file. After that, Tax Calculator uses the Google Sheets API to read cell values, add new rows, update specific ranges and clear ranges exclusively in that document (e.g. income, expenses, clients). The app has no access to other documents in your Google account.",

  "privacySectionScopes": "Google API permissions (scopes)",
  "privacyScopesDetails": "Tax Calculator uses the following Google API permissions that are necessary for the app to work:\n\n• openid – for secure user login.\n• https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets – for reading and updating Google Sheets document content (reading ranges, adding rows, updating and deleting cell ranges).\n• https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file – for selecting a specific file on Google Drive via Google Picker.\n\nWe do not use \"email\" permissions or other sensitive or restricted Google API permissions that are not necessary for the application to function. We limit access exclusively to the document that the user manually selects and to the ranges that the app updates for data calculations.",

  "privacySectionDataUse": "How we use data",
  "privacyDataUseDetails": "We use access to the Google account and selected Google Sheets document exclusively to:\n\n• enable login to the app,\n• read data from the selected Sheets file for calculations and display in the app,\n• write new entries, add rows, clear specific ranges and update only necessary parts of the document for up-to-date record keeping.\n\nWe do not use your Google data for advertising, marketing or creating user profiles. We do not sell or rent your data to third parties and do not use data from Google Drive/Sheets files to train general AI/ML models.",

  "privacySectionDataProtection": "Storage, protection and sharing of data",
  "privacyDataProtectionDetails": "The content of your Google Sheets documents remains within your Google account. The app reads this data \"on demand\" and, if necessary, caches it briefly for performance. Such data is stored for the shortest possible time and is protected by appropriate technical measures (HTTPS/TLS, access control, etc.).\n\nWe do not share data with third parties except with trusted technical providers (e.g. hosting), and only to the extent necessary for the app to work, with a contractual obligation to protect data.",

  "privacySectionUserRights": "Your rights and data deletion",
  "privacyUserRightsDetails": "You can revoke app access at any time via your Google account page:\nhttps://myaccount.google.com/permissions\n\nYou can also contact us if you want us to delete data stored within the app itself (e.g. local configurations). After identity verification, we will delete or anonymize the data, except for data we are legally required to retain (e.g. accounting records).",
